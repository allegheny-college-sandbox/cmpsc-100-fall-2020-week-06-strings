    "## `string`ing you along\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point in the semester, we've worked with `string` objects largely through `print` statements. While we will still do some of that, this week, we're exploring the more advanced world of what lies beneath the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a string?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"textbook\" definition of the `string` is that it's simply a collection of _symbols_. These symbols can be anything that is computer-recognizable. Typically this means letters (`qweituortrgdafgdg`), symbols (`##@*!#!)` -- again, I'm not _that_ upset about it), or numbers-as-symbols. This last one is a little strange. Just remember that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 4 \\neq{\"4\"} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the above, `4` is the _integer_ representation -- a number. The other, `\"4\"` is the `string` representation of the symbol `4`. This is why we get the lovely `TypeError` in when we attempt to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-1-ebbc32cdfe85> in <module>\n",
    "----> 1 s = 4  + \"4\"\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the definition: we can then say that a `string` is simply a group of symbols known as _characters_ which can display nearly anything that language can provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, I can also tell you that your computer doesn't actually care about the symbol. That's just a human convenience. All a system really cares about is that _each symbol is stored at a different place_ in a gigantic set of characters called the Unicode Coded Character Set (or just \"Unicode\"). Speaking of the majority of English-language characters, we can say they're stored in a _subset_ (that is, smaller portion of) this standard that we call [ASCII (the American Standard Code for Information Interchange)](http://www.asciitable.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This table, known as the \"ASCII Table\" contains entries for various letters which refer to decimal (or `DEC`) representations of symbols which actually refer to letters. Here's what that looks like from a programming perspective:"
